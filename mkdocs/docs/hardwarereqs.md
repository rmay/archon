# Hardware requirements

Low. If you bought anything new in the past 10 years, odds are it'll run Archon.

Take, for instance, all those machines running Windows 10 but can't run Windows 11 because MS reasons. Archon will run happily on anything with a couple of cores and 2 gigs of RAM and at least 20 gigs of storage.

If you can install Arch on it, that's half the battle.
